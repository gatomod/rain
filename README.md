# Rain
An extremely minimalist video delivery platform made with React and Rust.

## Note
This was my first project in Rust, I made it a few years ago to use that language in a real project, but the code is too messy and inneficient so please, don't bother me with that.

I have the intention to rewrite it with the same stack and using it for my Final Degree Project, organizing it better, documenting it and using another libraries.

## Getting started
To start using Rain you need to install certain programs and build it.
### Configuration
Before build Rain, you need to configure `server.toml`

- In `server.toml` set the port and the file limit (in bytes)
```toml
ip = [0, 0, 0, 0]
port = 3000
file_limit = 10_000_000_000 # In bytes
```


### Docker

```sh
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/gatomod/rain && cd rain

# Build Dockerfile
docker build -t gatomo/rain:latest .

# Run the container
# - Choose a port. 80 is the default one
# - Volumes are used to preserve data. Choose a path
docker run --name rain -p 80:80 -v /route/to/store/cdn:/server/cdn gatomo/rain
```

### Manual build
#### Prerequisites
